## Summarizing Leisure Activity Resorts by Country
 
Given a table playground.country_activities with columns: id (unique identifier), country (name of the country), region (region within the country), leisure_activity_type (type of leisure activity), and number_of_places (number of resorts offering the activity). Construct a SQL query to aggregate this information into a new table structure. The resulting table should have columns for each country, with the counts of resorts offering each type of activity: adventure_park, golf, river_cruise, and kart_racing. Sort the result by country name in ascending order.

### These are the tables to query for this question:
**playground.country_activities**
- id int
- country string
- region string
- leisure_activity_type string
- number_of_places int
### Your answer should include these columns:
- country varchar
- adventure_park integer
- golf integer
- river_cruise integer
- kart_racing integer

## Answer
```sql
WITH A AS (
  SELECT country,
    CASE WHEN LOWER(leisure_activity_type) = 'adventure park'
      THEN number_of_places ELSE 0 END AS adventure_park,
    CASE WHEN LOWER(leisure_activity_type) = 'golf'
      THEN number_of_places ELSE 0 END AS golf,
    CASE WHEN LOWER(leisure_activity_type) = 'river cruise'
      THEN number_of_places ELSE 0 END AS river_cruise,
    CASE WHEN LOWER(leisure_activity_type) = 'kart racing'
      THEN number_of_places ELSE 0 END AS kart_racing
  FROM playground.country_activities
)
SELECT country, 
  SUM(adventure_park) AS adventure_park, 
  SUM(golf) AS golf,
  SUM(river_cruise) AS river_cruise, 
  SUM(kart_racing) AS kart_racing
FROM A
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```
