## Identifying the Bank Robber
 
Using table playground.suspect, filter out suspects who cannot be the bank robber based on the following clues: the robber is not taller than 170cm, and their name matches the pattern "B. Gre?n" where the first letter of the name is "B" or "b" and the surname is similar to "Green" but with the fourth letter being unreadable and potentially any character. The match should be case-insensitive. For each suspect that fits these criteria, select their id, name, and surname. Order the results by suspect id in ascending order.

### These are the tables to query for this question:
#### **playground.suspect**
- id int
- name string
- surname string
- height int
- weight int
### Your answer should include these columns:
- id integer
- name varchar
- surname varchar

## Answer
```sql
SELECT id, name, surname 
FROM playground.suspect
WHERE height <= 170
AND LOWER(name) LIKE 'b%'
AND LOWER(surname) LIKE 'gre_n'
ORDER BY id
```

## Results
| id | name    | surname |
|----|---------|---------|
| 2  | Bill    | Green   |
| 5  | Brendon | Grewn   |
| 6  | bill    | Green   |
