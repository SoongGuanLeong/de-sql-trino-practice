## Filtering Students in Active Clubs
 
Given tables clubs (id: unique club id, name: club name) and students (id: unique student id, name: student name, club_id: club's id), return a list from the students table for those who are in clubs that still exist in the clubs table. The result should have three columns (id, name, club_id) and be sorted by students' ids (id) and include only those students whose club_id matches an id in the clubs table.

### These are the tables to query for this question:
#### **playground.clubs**
- id int
- name string
#### **playground.students**
- id int
- name string
- club_id int
### Your answer should include these columns:
- id integer
- name varchar
- club_id integer

## Answer
```sql
SELECT *
FROM playground.students
WHERE club_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM playground.clubs
)
```

## Results
| id | name          | club_id |
|----|---------------|---------|
