Write a SQL query to return the US customers who rented a video on February 1st, 2023, and then streamed the same video between February 2nd and February 8th, 2023. Use the tables playground.rental for rental data and playground.streams for streaming data. The output should include unique user IDs of these customers ordered in ascending order.

### These are the tables to query for this question:

#### **playground.streams**
- country string
- stream_date date
- rental_id int
- user_id int
- device_type string

## Answer
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT r.user_id
FROM playground.rental r JOIN playground.streams s
ON r.rental_id = s.rental_id

    r.country = 'US'
    AND rental_date = DATE '2023-02-01'
    AND stream_date BETWEEN DATE '2023-02-02' AND DATE '2023-03-08'
ORDER BY 1
