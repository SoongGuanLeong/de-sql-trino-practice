# DataExpert.io SQL Practice Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to all SQL questions from [DataExpert.io SQL Questions](https://www.dataexpert.io/questions).

## Repository Structure
Each file corresponds to a specific question from the site:
- `1-easy/1.md`
- `1-easy/2.md`
- ...
  
I use consistent formatting and best practices in SQL:
- Explicit `JOIN` conditions
- Meaningful alias names
- Window functions where appropriate
- Clear use of `CASE` and aggregation logic

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is:
- To track my learning progress in SQL
- To demonstrate problem-solving approaches and clean SQL style
- To serve as a reference for anyone preparing for SQL/data interviews

## Notes
- All solutions are my own work.
- There may be multiple valid approaches to each problem; I chose the ones that are clean and efficient.
- Some queries may be written in ANSI SQL; minor adjustments might be needed depending on your SQL dialect.
