## Identify Products Sold Exclusively in January 2024
 
Using the tables playground.products and playground.product_sales, write a SQL query to find products that were sold exclusively within the month of January 2024 (from "2024-01-01" to "2024-01-31", inclusive). The output should include the product_id and product_name for each qualifying product.

### These are the tables to query for this question:
**playground.products**
- product_id int
- product_name string
- unit_price int
**playground.product_sales**
- seller_id int
- product_id int
- buyer_id int
- sale_date date
- quantity int
- price int
### Your answer should include these columns:
- product_id integer
- product_name varchar

## Answer
```sql
WITH A AS (
  SELECT seller_id,
    COALESCE(s.product_id, p.product_id) AS product_id,
    product_name,
    buyer_id,
    sale_date,
    CASE 
        WHEN YEAR(sale_date) = 2024 AND MONTH(sale_date) = 1
        THEN 1 ELSE 0
    END AS is_jan_2024,
    unit_price,
    quantity,
    price
  FROM playground.product_sales s
  FULL OUTER JOIN playground.products p
  ON s.product_id = p.product_id
),
B AS (
  SELECT product_id, product_name,
    EXP(SUM(LN(is_jan_2024))) AS is_exclusive
  FROM A
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT product_id, product_name FROM B
WHERE is_exclusive = 1
```

## Results
| product_id | product_name |
