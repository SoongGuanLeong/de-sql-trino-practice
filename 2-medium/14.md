## Calculate Monthly Average Product Rating
 
Using the table playground.product_reviews, write a SQL query to calculate the monthly average rating for each product. The resulting table should have three columns: month, product_id, and avg_review, where avg_review is the average review rating of the product for that month. The results should be ordered in ascending order of month and product_id

### These are the tables to query for this question:
**playground.product_reviews**
- seller_id int
- customer_id int
- product_id int
- review_date date
- review_score double
- helpful_votes int
### Your answer should include these columns:
- month integer
- product_id integer
- avg_review double

## Answer
```sql
SELECT 
  MONTH(review_date) AS month,
  product_id,
  AVG(review_score) AS avg_review
FROM playground.product_reviews
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2
LIMIT 1
```

## Results
| month | product_id | avg_review |
|-------|------------|------------|
| 1     | 202        | 4.5        |
