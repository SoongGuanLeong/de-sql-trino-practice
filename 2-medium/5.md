## Finding Highest Grade and Corresponding Course per Student
 
Using the table playground.student_grades, write a SQL query to find the highest grade and its corresponding course for each student. In cases where there is a tie for the highest grade, select the course with the smallest course_id. The output should include student_id, course_id, and the grade, with the results sorted by increasing student_id.

### These are the tables to query for this question:
**playground.student_grades**
- student_id int
- course_id int
- grade int
### Your answer should include these columns:
- student_id integer
- course_id integer
- grade integer

## Answer
```sql
WITH A AS (
  SELECT *,
    ROW_NUMBER() 
      OVER(PARTITION BY student_id
      ORDER BY grade DESC, course_id) AS row_num
  FROM playground.student_grades
)
SELECT student_id, course_id, grade
FROM A
WHERE row_num=1
ORDER BY student_id
```

## Results
| student_id | course_id | grade |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
