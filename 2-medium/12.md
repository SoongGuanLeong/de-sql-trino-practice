## Identifying students with the best grade
 
Using the playground.marks table, write a SQL query to determine the students who achieved the highest marks when graded according to Option 3, where the final exam accounts for 100% of the grade. The other grading options are provided for context: Option 1: Midterm 1 contributes 25%, Midterm 2 contributes 25%, and the Final exam contributes 50% of the grade. Option 2: Midterm 1 contributes 50% and Midterm 2 contributes 50% of the grade. Option 3: The Final exam contributes 100% of the grade. The output should be sorted by the students' names in ascending order. Ensure the column names in the result are displayed in lowercase. The resultant table should have two columns, name and their id.

### These are the tables to query for this question:
**playground.marks**
- Name string
- ID int
- Midterm1 int
- Midterm2 int
- Final int
### Your answer should include these columns:
- name varchar
- id integer

## Answer
```sql
WITH results AS(
  SELECT
    name, id,
    0.25 * midterm1 + 0.25 * midterm2 + 0.5 * final AS option1,
    0.5 * midterm1 + 0.5 * midterm2 AS option2,
    final AS option3
  FROM playground.marks
)
SELECT name, id FROM results
WHERE option3 > option1 AND option3 > option2
ORDER BY name
```

## Results
| name     | id    |
|----------|-------|
| David    | 42334 |
| Jonathan | 58754 |
| Jonty    | 11000 |
