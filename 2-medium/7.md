## Identifying Active Businesses Based on Event Occurrences
 
Using the playground.business_events table, identify all active businesses. An active business is defined as one that has more than one event type with occurrences greater than the average occurrences of that event type among all businesses. The goal is to filter businesses based on their activity level, comparing individual event occurrences to the overall average for those event types. The result should be a table with one column called business_id with all the business ids that are active.

### These are the tables to query for this question:
**playground.business_events**
- business_id int
- event_type string
- occurences int
### Your answer should include these columns:
- business_id integer

## Answer
```sql
-- my version
WITH A AS (
  SELECT
    event_type,
    AVG(occurences) AS avg_occurences
  FROM playground.business_events
  GROUP BY event_type
),
B AS (
  SELECT * 
  FROM playground.business_events be
  JOIN A 
  ON be.event_type = A.event_type
),
C AS (
  SELECT 
    business_id, 
    COUNT(business_id) AS no_event_type
  FROM B
  WHERE occurences > avg_occurences
  GROUP BY business_id
)
SELECT business_id
FROM C
WHERE no_event_type > 1
ORDER BY 1

WITH A AS (
  SELECT
    business_id,
    event_type,
    occurences,
    AVG(occurences) OVER (PARTITION BY event_type) AS avg_occurences
  FROM playground.business_events
),
B AS (
  SELECT 
    business_id,
    COUNT(*) AS no_event_type
  FROM A
  WHERE occurences > avg_occurences
  GROUP BY business_id
)
SELECT business_id
FROM B
WHERE no_event_type > 1
ORDER BY business_id;
```

## Results
| business_id |
|-------------|
| 1           |
