## Which states have high risk of fatal collisions involving Alcohol
 
Using playground.bad_drivers, determine the states and their percentage of alcohol impaired collisions where the risk of fatal collisions involving alcohol is significantly higher than the national average. Consider a state as high-risk if its percent_alcohol_impaired is at least 20% higher than the national average. Show the output in descending order of the percent_alcohol_impaired.

### These are the tables to query for this question:
**playground.bad_drivers**
- state string
- fatal_collisions_per_billion_miles double
- percent_speeding int
- percent_alcohol_impaired int
- percent_not_distracted int
- percent_no_previous_accidents int
- insurance_premiums double
- losses_per_insured_driver double
### Your answer should include these columns:
- state varchar
- percent_alcohol_impaired integer

## Answer
```sql
SELECT 
    state, percent_alcohol_impaired
FROM playground.bad_drivers
WHERE percent_alcohol_impaired >= 
    (SELECT AVG(percent_alcohol_impaired) * 1.2
    FROM playground.bad_drivers)
ORDER BY percent_alcohol_impaired DESC
```

## Results
| state          | percent_alcohol_impaired |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Montana        | 44                       |
| North Dakota   | 42                       |
| Hawaii         | 41                       |
| South Carolina | 41                       |
| Rhode Island   | 38                       |
| Texas          | 38                       |
