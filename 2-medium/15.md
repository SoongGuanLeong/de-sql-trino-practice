## Transform workers_info Table to Exclude NULL Values
 
Given a table named playground.workers_info, write a SQL query to transform this table. The transformation should result in a table with three columns: id, column_name, and value, where column_name is the name of the original column containing a non-NULL value for each id, and value is the stringified non-NULL value from this column. Exclude rows where the original value is NULL. The result should be sorted by id in ascending order, and for rows with the same id, sorted by column_name in ascending order.

### These are the tables to query for this question:
**playground.workers_info**
- id int
- name string
- date_of_birth date
- salary int
### Your answer should include these columns:
- id integer
- column_name varchar
- value varchar

## Answer
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 'name' AS column_name,
  name AS value
FROM playground.workers_info
WHERE name IS NOT NULL
UNION
SELECT
  id, 'date_of_birth' AS column_name,
  CAST(date_of_birth AS VARCHAR) AS value
FROM playground.workers_info
WHERE date_of_birth IS NOT NULL
UNION
SELECT
  id, 'salary' AS column_name,
  CAST(salary AS VARCHAR) AS value
FROM playground.workers_info
WHERE salary IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY id, column_name
```

## Results
| id | column_name   | value          |

| 1  | name          | Justin Penrose |
