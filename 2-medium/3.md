## Comparing State Fatal Collisions to the National Average
 
Using playground.bad_drivers, write a SQL query to compare each stateâ€™s fatal collisions per billion miles to the national average. Include a column that indicates whether the state is "Above Average" or "Below Average". The resultant table should have three columns, "state", "fatal_collisions_per_billion_miles" and "comparison_to_national_avg". Show the result ordered by state name asc.

### These are the tables to query for this question:
**playground.bad_drivers**
- state string
- fatal_collisions_per_billion_miles double
- percent_speeding int
- percent_alcohol_impaired int
- percent_not_distracted int
- percent_no_previous_accidents int
- insurance_premiums double
- losses_per_insured_driver double
### Your answer should include these columns:
- state varchar
- fatal_collisions_per_billion_miles double
- comparison_to_national_avg varchar

## Answer
```sql
SELECT
  state,
  fatal_collisions_per_billion_miles,
  CASE
    WHEN fatal_collisions_per_billion_miles >= (SELECT AVG(fatal_collisions_per_billion_miles) FROM playground.bad_drivers) THEN 'Above Average'
    ELSE 'Below Average'
  END AS comparison_to_national_avg
FROM playground.bad_drivers
ORDER BY state
```
