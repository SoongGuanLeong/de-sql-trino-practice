## Calculate 3-Day Rolling Average of Posts per User
 
Using the table playground.posts, write a SQL query to calculate the 3-day rolling average of posts for each user. The output should include columns: user_id, post_date, and third_rolling_avg, where third_rolling_avg is the 3-day rolling average of post count for each user, rounded to 2 decimal places. The rolling average should be calculated over a specified 3-day period for each user, including the current day and the two preceding days. The result should be ordered in ascending order of post date

### These are the tables to query for this question:
**playground.posts**
- user_id int
- post_date date
- post_count int
### Your answer should include these columns:
- user_id integer
- post_date date
- third_rolling_avg double

## Answer
```sql
SELECT
  user_id,
  post_date,
  ROUND(AVG(post_count) OVER (
    PARTITION BY user_id
    ORDER BY post_date
    ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ), 2) AS third_rolling_avg
FROM playground.posts
ORDER BY user_id, post_date
```

## Results
| user_id | post_date  | third_rolling_avg |
